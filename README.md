# Covalence-Package

Git is an amazing collaborative tool, but can be clumsy and confusing when it comes to pair programming or small changes. Covalence is an Atom package that aims to bridge the gap (and reduce the amount of merge conflicts) by enabling you to simultaneously live-edit code with your teammates. Covalence also has built-in version control: simply press a hotkey at any breakpoint of your choosing, then view the entire history of your file in one place.
